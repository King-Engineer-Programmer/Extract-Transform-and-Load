# Extract-Transform-and-Load

Crowdfunding ETL
For this assignment, you’ll use Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the contact information from a CSV file. When doing so, you’ll create a DataFrame that you’ll export as a CSV file. Then, you'll use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Next, you’ll add the new table to the crowdfunding_db database that you created in the ETL mini project. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data and perform a data analysis by using SQL queries.
